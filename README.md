# MSc Project
Here is the code used for my MSc project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Nulcear Images for Soft Tissue Sarcoma

In the project we apply unsupervised dimension reduction methods to detect abnormal cell nuclei in unlabelled nulcear image data, and then extend the results to further samples using supervised classification. The aim is to explore new ways of extracting information from nuclear images that can help better diagnose or predict clinical outcome for Sarcoma (a type of cancer).
